# Steganography App
Project for Steganography AGH course, created together with [@bojdyst](https://www.github.com/bojdyst). <br>

Our application includes implementations of steganographic methods for hiding messages in images based on the following publications: 
1. (RDH grayscale) B. Li, "Secure Reversible Data Hiding in Images with Scalable Capacity," 2023 Asia Symposium on Image Processing (ASIP), Tianjin, China, 2023, pp. 74-78, doi: 10.1109/ASIP58895.2023.00020.

And two implemetations based on (but with some logic changed) the following papers:
1. Custom Chaos Implementation using Henon's algorithm.
